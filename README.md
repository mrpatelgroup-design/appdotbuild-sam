# app.build (agent)

**app.build** is an open-source AI agent for generating production-ready applications with testing, linting and deployment setup from a single prompt. This agent relies heavily on scaffolding and extensive validation to ensure high-quality outputs.

There are two generations of this agent:

### v1 - Python implementation (⚠️ deprecated)

Original standalone agent located in `./agent/` directory (no longer actively maintained). This version can still be used and forked, it is designed to generate CRUD applications on three stacks: (TypeScript + tRPC + Drizzle + React, Python + NiceGUI + SQLModel, PHP + Laravel). The managed service has been discontinued.

See [agent/README.md](agent/README.md) for setup and some usage instructions.

Work report is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03310).

### v2 - Rust implementation 🦀

It is located in `./edda/` directory (under active development). The purpose of this version is to build a more robust architecture with a focus on data applications (dashboards, analytics, data-driven tools).

Unlike the Python version, it is available not only as a standalone agent but also as a MCP powering your favorite agents (like Claude Code) or being wrapped into custom agents programmatically (see `klaudbiusz/cli/codegen.py` for the example of using with Claude Agent SDK).

### MCP Installation

**Prerequisites:**
- OCI-compatible container runtime (Docker, OrbStack, Podman...) must be installed and running for Dagger-based sandboxed execution

Try it out!

```
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appdotbuild/agent/refs/heads/main/edda/install.sh | sh
```
and attach to your favorite MCP client, e.g. Claude Code:
```
claude mcp add --transport stdio edda -- ~/.local/bin/edda_mcp
```

**Set Databricks environment variables** (required for app generation):
```bash
export DATABRICKS_HOST=https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com
export DATABRICKS_TOKEN=dapi...
export DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID=your-warehouse-id
```

Then start using it with Claude Code:
```bash
# Create project dir
mkdir ~/dbrx-sales-by-region && cd ~/dbrx-sales-by-region

# Check the 'edda' MCP is available fo claude
claude mcp list

# Run sample app generation
claude "Create a Databricks app that shows daily sales by region"
```

**To deploy to Databricks** (optional, requires write to /usr/local/bin), install Databricks CLI:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/setup-cli/main/install.sh | sudo sh
```

```
